 LICENSE:  My Wiimote library is free for any use (including
            commercial), with the following conditions:

1) Don't use it to harm anyone, directly or indirectly,
   including but not limited to military use (bruising
   egos is fine ;).
   
2) Any distribution in binary form (ie. linked with your
   program) must include the following text in your
   distro's documentation (ReadMe file, help file,
   About box and/or splash screen):

   "contains WiiYourself! wiimote code by gl.tter
    http://gl.tter.org"

3) Any distribution in source code form must keep all my
   copyright notices intact unmodified (you can add to
   them if you've made changes), and must include this
   license text (either include this file in your
   distribution, or paste its contents into your distro's
   licence file).

4) Don't use the code to produce a competing library
   unless you rewrite it considerably (eg. to convert it
   to another language, but contact me first).
  
   Instead please contribute new features, fixes and ideas.
